<h1>Ant colony Simulation</h1>

<p>done on Processing, but it's not in a state to reuse.</p>

<h2>what can I expect from this repository :</h2>

<p> It's simply an example of Ant colony simulation with those rules :</p>
<ul>
  <li>your colony is defined by user by clicking.</li>
  <li>ants will roam to find food.</li>
  <li>drop "return home" (blue) pheromone to retrieve they way to destination.</li>
  <li>drop "recruit" (red) pheromone to call other when food is found.</li>
  <li>I added a simple rule which is to replant while roaming if another ant is already collecting at its location, and until it finds another place..</li>
</ul>
