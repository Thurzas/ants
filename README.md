<h1>Ant colony Simulation</h1>

<p> it is a one week challenge to understand the Ant Colony Optimisation </p>
<p>done with java Processing, but it's not in a state to reuse.</p>
<h2>what can I expect from this repository :</h2>

<p> It's simply an example of Ant Colony Simulation with those rules :</p>
<ul>
  <li>click somewhere to place your colony.</li>
  <li>ants will roam to find food.</li>
  <li>those ants drop "return home" (blue) pheromone to retrieve their way to the colony.</li>
  <li>they also drop "recruit" (red) pheromone to call other when food is found.</li>
  <li>I added a simple rule which is to farm while roaming if another ant is already harvesting at its location, and it farms until it finds another place to harvest..</li>
</ul>
